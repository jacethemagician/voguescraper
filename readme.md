A simple Python script for downloading images from Vogue fashion shows. It uses Selenium to automate the web browser, fetch the images, and save them locally.

## üöÄFeatures
- **Automated Browsing:** Uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate and interact with the Vogue website.
- **Image Downloading:** Downloads images from a specified fashion show season and brand.
- **Directory Management:** Creates and manages directories for saving images.
- **Paywall Ad Handling:** Attempts to disable the ad banner on the Vogue website.
- **Incremental Scrolling:** Scrolls the page incrementally to load more content, with an option for the user to enable or disable scrolling.

## üìãRequirements
- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver
- The following Python libraries:
  - requests
  - shutil
  - loguru
  - selenium
  - webdriver_manager
  - lxml
  - tqdm

## üíæInstallation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vogue-fashion-show-scraper.git
   cd vogue-fashion-show-scraper
   ```

2. **Install the Required Python Packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üïπÔ∏èUsage

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```sh
   python vogue_se.py
   ```
   - A Chrome webpage will pop up. Do not close the page unless the program completes or fails.

2. **Enter the Fashion Show Season:**
   When prompted, enter the season name (e.g., `Fall 2024 Ready-to-Wear`).
   - Pay attention to spaces and format.

3. **Enter the Brand Name:**
   When prompted, enter the brand name (e.g., `yohji-yamamoto`).
   - If unsure, check the brand name on Vogue. The format should be lowercase letters connected with hyphens.

4. **Choose to Scroll or Not:**
   When prompted, enter `yes` to enable scrolling to load more images or `no` to disable scrolling.
   - This parameter controls whether to mimic scrolling on the specific runway webpage. It's almost always `yes`, but in some rare scenarios, it can be `no`. Please try it out.

5. **Wait for Images to Download:**
   The script will navigate to the specified season's page, scroll to load all images (if enabled), and download them into a directory named after the brand and season.
   - The saved directory is named in the format of brand + season (e.g., `yohji-yamamoto_Fall 2024 Ready-to-Wear`).

## ‚ö†Ô∏èTroubleshooting

1. **ChromeDriver Issues:**
   Ensure you have the latest version of ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome browser. This is managed by `webdriver_manager`, but manual checks can help.

2. **Website Changes:**
   Vogue's website structure might change, affecting the script. Further tweaks might be necessary based on the site's updates.

3. **Slow Performance:**
   Increase the sleep intervals in the `scroll_incrementally` function to allow more time for content to load.
